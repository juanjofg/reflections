How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Used to use version control tools, I found this a bit harder

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You don´t need to get worried about how to manage this history.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: when saving manually, you choose what you commit and could add a message to it. When saving automatically, you don´t need to worry about saving or commiting.
    Cons: manually saving, could end up in a really big commits. Automatically savings could be nonsense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think that it is a more flexible way of working, letting you bind related commits and files together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log gives you a list/history of changes made in the files/repository
    Git diff allows you to compare changes between commits on one or multiple files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You assure you could check where you made changes and easily find errors. Also it allows you to navigate back and forth to test changes. You know that you are not loosing any change

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
